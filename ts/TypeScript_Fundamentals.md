# TypeScript Fundamentals Homework

## Task 1: Variables and Data Types (Simple)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Declare a variable named `myName` of type `string` and assign it your name.
2. Declare a variable named `myAge` of type `number` and assign it your age.
3. Declare a variable named `isProgrammer` of type `boolean` and assign it a boolean value depending on whether you are a programmer or not.
4. Log all these variables to the console.

## Task 2: Basic Operators (Simple)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Declare two variables `num1` and `num2` of type `number` and assign them any two numbers.
2. Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on these numbers.
3. Log the results to the console.

## Task 3: Control Structures (Medium)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Write a for loop that logs numbers from 1 to 10 to the console.
2. Write a while loop that logs numbers from 10 to 1 to the console.
3. Write an if-else statement that logs 'even' if a number is even and 'odd' if a number is odd.

## Task 4: Functions (Medium)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Write a function named `greet` that takes a name as a parameter of type `string` and logs a greeting message to the console.
2. Write a function named `add` that takes two numbers as parameters of type `number` and returns their sum.
3. Write a function named `isEven` that takes a number as a parameter of type `number` and returns true if the number is even and false if the number is odd.

## Task 5: Arrays (Hard)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Declare an array named `fruits` of type `string[]` and assign it some array of fruit names.
2. Log the first and last fruit in the array to the console.
3. Add a fruit to the beginning and end of the array and log the array to the console.
4. Remove a fruit from the beginning and end of the array and log the array to the console.

## Task 6: Objects (Hard)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Declare an object named `person` and give it properties `name`, `age`, and `job` with appropriate values and types.
2. Log the person's name and job to the console.
3. Add a property `hobby` to the person object and log the object to the console.
4. Delete the `job` property from the person object and log the object to the console.
