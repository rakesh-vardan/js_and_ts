# TypeScript Fundamentals Homework

## Task 1: Variables and Data Types (Simple)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Declare a variable named `myName` of type `string` and assign it your name.
2. Declare a variable named `myAge` of type `number` and assign it your age.
3. Declare a variable named `isProgrammer` of type `boolean` and assign it a boolean value depending on whether you are a programmer or not.
4. Log all these variables to the console.

## Task 2: Basic Operators (Simple)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Declare two variables `num1` and `num2` of type `number` and assign them any two numbers.
2. Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on these numbers.
3. Log the results to the console.

## Task 3: Control Structures (Medium)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Write a for loop that logs numbers from 1 to 10 to the console.
2. Write a while loop that logs numbers from 10 to 1 to the console.
3. Write an if-else statement that logs 'even' if a number is even and 'odd' if a number is odd.

## Task 4: Functions (Medium)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Write a function named `greet` that takes a name as a parameter of type `string` and logs a greeting message to the console.
2. Write a function named `add` that takes two numbers as parameters of type `number` and returns their sum.
3. Write a function named `isEven` that takes a number as a parameter of type `number` and returns true if the number is even and false if the number is odd.

## Task 5: Arrays (Hard)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Declare an array named `fruits` of type `string[]` and assign it some array of fruit names.
2. Log the first and last fruit in the array to the console.
3. Add a fruit to the beginning and end of the array and log the array to the console.
4. Remove a fruit from the beginning and end of the array and log the array to the console.

## Task 6: Objects (Hard)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Declare an object named `person` and give it properties `name`, `age`, and `job` with appropriate values and types.
2. Log the person's name and job to the console.
3. Add a property `hobby` to the person object and log the object to the console.
4. Delete the `job` property from the person object and log the object to the console.

## Task 7: String Manipulation (Simple)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Declare a variable named `sentence` of type `string` and assign it a string of your choice.
2. Log the length of the string to the console.
3. Convert the string to uppercase and log it to the console.
4. Convert the string to lowercase and log it to the console.

## Task 8: Math Object (Simple)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Use the Math object to generate a random number between 1 and 10 and log it to the console.
2. Use the Math object to find the square root of a number and log it to the console.

## Task 9: Date Object (Medium)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Use the Date object to get the current date and time and log it to the console.
2. Use the Date object to get the current year and log it to the console.
3. Use the Date object to get the current month and 
arameter of type `number[]` and returns the largest number in the array.
3. Write a function that takes a number as a parameter of type `number` and checks if the number is within a certain range (for example, between 10 and 20).

## Task 10: Functions and Scope (Medium)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Write a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns the larger number.
2. Write a function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and returns the largest number in the array.
3. Write a function that takes a number as a parameter and checks if the number is within a certain range (for example, between 10 and 20).

## Task 11: Working with JSON (Hard)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Declare a JavaScript object with properties `name`, `age`, and `job` with appropriate types.
2. Convert the object to a JSON string using `JSON.stringify()` and log it to the console.
3. Convert the JSON string back to a JavaScript object using `JSON.parse()` and log it to the console.

## Task 12: Error Handling (Hard)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Write a function that throws an error with a message of your choice.
2. Use a try-catch block to catch the error and log the error message to the console.
