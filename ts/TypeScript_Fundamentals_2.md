# TypeScript Fundamentals Homework - Set 2

## Task 1: var, let and const (Simple)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Declare a variable using `var`, `let`, and `const` and assign them some values.
2. Try to reassign the `const` variable and observe the error.

## Task 2: Types, Interfaces, and Enums (Medium)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Declare a variable of each basic type in TypeScript (boolean, number, string, array, tuple, enum, any, void, null, and undefined).
2. Create an interface for a `Person` object with properties `name`, `age`, and `job`.
3. Create an enum for `Days` of the week.

## Task 3: Generics (Medium)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Create a generic function that accepts an argument of any type and returns the type of the argument.

## Task 4: Arrow Functions (Simple)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Write a simple arrow function that takes two numbers and returns their sum.

## Task 5: map, filter, and reduce (Hard)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Declare an array of numbers and use `map` to create a new array where each number is doubled.
2. Use `filter` to create a new array that only includes the even numbers from the original array.
3. Use `reduce` to find the sum of all numbers in the original array.

## Task 6: Return Type (Medium)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Write a function that returns a string and specify the return type in the function signature.

## Task 7: Module Import and Exports (Hard)
Create two TypeScript files and do the following:

1. In the first file, export a function that returns "Hello, World!".
2. In the second file, import the function from the first file and call it.

## Task 8: Spread Operator (Medium)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Declare two arrays and use the spread operator to combine them into a third array.

## Task 9: Destructuring (Medium)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Declare an object and an array and use destructuring to assign their properties/values to variables.

## Task 10: Callback Function and Promises (Hard)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Write a function that takes a callback function as a parameter and calls it.
2. Write a function that returns a Promise that resolves after 2 seconds and call it.

## Task 11: Iteration of List of Elements (Medium)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Declare an array of numbers and use a for loop to iterate over it and log each number to the console.


# TypeScript Advanced Homework


## Task 12: Advanced Types (Hard)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Create a type alias for a union type that could be a number or a string.
2. Create a function that takes a parameter of the type you just created and logs the type of the parameter.

## Task 13: Advanced Interfaces (Hard)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Create an interface for a `Person` object with properties `name`, `age`, and a method `greet`.
2. Implement the `Person` interface with a class.
3. Create an instance of the class and call the `greet` method.

## Task 14: Advanced Generics (Hard)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Create a generic class with a generic method that adds an item to an array.
2. Create an instance of the class for a specific type and use it to add items to an array.

## Task 15: Advanced map, filter, and reduce (Hard)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Declare an array of objects where each object has a `name` and `age` property.
2. Use `map` to create a new array of the names of each person.
3. Use `filter` to create a new array that only includes the people older than 20 from the original array.
4. Use `reduce` to find the average age of all people in the original array.

## Task 16: Advanced Module Import and Exports (Hard)
Create two TypeScript files and do the following:

1. In the first file, export a class with a method.
2. In the second file, import the class from the first file, create an instance of the class, and call the method.

## Task 17: Advanced Spread Operator (Hard)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Declare three objects and use the spread operator to combine them into a fourth object.

## Task 18: Advanced Destructuring (Hard)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Declare a nested object and array and use destructuring to assign their properties/values to variables.

## Task 19: Advanced Promises (Hard)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Write a function that returns a Promise that resolves after a random amount of time.
2. Use `Promise.all` to call the function multiple times and log when all promises have resolved.

## Task 20: Advanced Iteration of List of Elements (Hard)
Create a TypeScript file and do the following:

1. Declare an array of objects where each object has a `name` and `age` property.
2. Use a for loop to iterate over it and log each name and age to the console.
